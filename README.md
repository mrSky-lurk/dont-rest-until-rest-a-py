Baby Steps into buildiREST APIs (Python Edition)



# REST API Adventures with Python 🚀  

This repo tracks my journey of learning how to **build and deploy my first REST API in Python**.  

I’m starting simple:  
- Write a basic API with Flask/FastAPI 🐍  
- Add endpoints & maybe a database  
- Deploy it online so the world can test it 🌍  

## Progress
- [x] Setup Python  
- [ ] Hello World API  
- [ ] Database & Deployment  

## Note  
This is a **learning log**, not a polished project. Expect messy commits, experiments, and “oops” moments 😅.
